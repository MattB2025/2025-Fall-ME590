# Project 1

This project directory includes a python script `initial_setup.py` that creates a set of Lagrangian points at $\tau=0$ which are ordered in a regular square grid of length $4 \times 4$ with $25 \times 25$ total points. To run this code, it requires standard installation of a `python` distribution with specific packages loaded. The two lines at the top of the script are the packages required, shown below.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

If you are new to the `python` programming language, you are welcome to use any other scripting or programming language that you feel more comfortable using. You will be required to upload your code to Canvas, in addition to the project write-up.

See the Canvas site for more project details, including deliverables, and equation derivations required.
